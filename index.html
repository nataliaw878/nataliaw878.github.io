					<p id="bottomP">I am a driven self-starter with an aptitude for working with others, developing content and presenting in effective and engaging ways. I am always interested in learning new skills, and even developed this website as a way to teach myself HTML and CSS. <br><br>At my time at Loyola University Chicago I started my own club and gained leadership skills in relating to people from diverse backgrounds, adapting my leadership style to make more people feel comfortable and giving constructive feedback to people of different skill levels, while also being able to take feedback myself. <br><br>In May 2020 I graduated with a degree in Public Relations and Advertising with Cum Laude Honors and am currently looking for opportunities in advertising, PR or marketing communications!  </p>
